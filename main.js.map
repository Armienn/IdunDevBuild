Strangely though, productivity growth had decreased during the same period. Economists found this turn of events\r\nso strange that\tthey called it the productivity paradox to underline their confusion. Productivity growth would take off in the late\r\n1990s, but then mysteriously drop again during the mid-aughts. At each juncture, experts would debate whether digital technology\r\nproduced real value or if it was all merely a mirage and that debate continued even as industry after industry was disrupted. Today,\r\nthat debate is over, but a new one is likely to begin over artificial intelligence. Much like in the early 1970s, we have increasing\r\ninvestment in a new technology, diminished productivity growth and \"experts\" predicting massive worker displacement . What's different\r\nis that now we have history and experience to guide us and can avoid making the\tsame mistakes.\tYou Can't Manage (or Evaluate) What\r\nYou Can't Measure. The productivity paradox dumbfounded economists because it violated a basic\r\nprinciple of how a free market economy is supposed to function. If profit seeking businesses continue to make substantial investments, you would\r\nexpect them to see a return. Yet with IT investment in the 70s and 80s, firms continued to increase their investment with negligible measurable\r\nbenefit. A paper by researchers at the University of Sheffield sheds some light on what happened. First, productivity measures were largely\r\ndeveloped for an industrial economy, not an information economy. Second, the value of those investments, while substantial, were a small portion\r\nof total capital investment. Third, the aggregate productivity numbers didn't reflect differences in management performance.` }],\r\n\t\tDate: \"2000-01-01\",\r\n\t\tPatientID: 1,\r\n\t\tStaffID: 1,\r\n\t\tExternalStaff: \"\"\r\n\t})\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst otherResponses = {}\r\n\r\notherResponses[baseUrl + \"getlistforpatient\"] = (parameters) => {\r\n\tconst result = list.filter(e => { return +parameters.id === +e.PatientID })\r\n\treturn JSON.stringify(result)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function JournalEntryResponses() {\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\t...ModelTestData.commonResponses(JournalEntry, baseUrl, list),\r\n\t\t...otherResponses\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n","﻿import { JournalTemplate } from \"idun-common/models/journal-template\"\r\nimport { ModelTestData } from \"./model-test-data\"\r\n\r\nconst baseUrl = \"api/journaltemplate/\"\r\n\r\nconst list = [\r\n\tnew JournalTemplate({\r\n\t\tDBID: 1,\r\n\t\tTitle: \"Journal test\",\r\n\t\tContent: \"The patient has a headache\",\r\n\t\tPlacements: [\"areas/head\"]\r\n\t}),\r\n]\r\n\r\nModelTestData.loadFromLocalStorage(baseUrl, list, JournalTemplate)\r\n\r\nexport function JournalTemplateResponses() {\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\t...ModelTestData.commonLocalStorageResponses(JournalTemplate, baseUrl, list)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n","﻿import { JournalEntry } from \"idun-common/models/journal-entry\"\r\nimport { ModelTestData } from \"./model-test-data\"\r\nimport * as english from \"../../assets/languages/english.json\"\r\n\r\nconst baseUrl = \"api/settings/\"\r\n\r\nconst otherResponses = {}\r\n\r\notherResponses[baseUrl + \"getlanguage\"] = (parameters) => {\r\n\treturn JSON.stringify(english)\r\n}\r\n\r\notherResponses[baseUrl + \"updatelanguage\"] = (parameters) => {\r\n\treturn JSON.stringify(parameters)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function LanguageResponses() {\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\t...otherResponses\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n","﻿import { Type } from \"@angular/core\"\r\nimport { IdunModel } from \"idun-common/models/idun-model\"\r\n\r\nconst deleted = {}\r\n\r\nexport abstract class ModelTestData {\r\n\r\n\tstatic commonResponses<Model extends IdunModel>(\r\n\t\tmodelClass: Type<Model>,\r\n\t\tbaseUrl: string,\r\n\t\tlist: Model[],\r\n\t\talternates: any = {}\r\n\t) {\r\n\t\tconst responses = {}\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"get\"] = ModelTestData.getResponse(list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"getlist\"] = ModelTestData.getListResponse(list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"getpage\"] = ModelTestData.getPageResponse(list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"add\"] = ModelTestData.addResponse(modelClass, list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"update\"] = ModelTestData.updateResponse(modelClass, list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"markfordeletion\"] = ModelTestData.deleteResponse(modelClass, list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"revertdelete\"] = ModelTestData.cancelDeleteResponse(modelClass, list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"getcount\"] = ModelTestData.getCountResponse(list)\r\n\t\tfor (const i in alternates)\r\n\t\t\tresponses[baseUrl + i] = alternates[i]\r\n\t\treturn responses\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tstatic commonLocalStorageResponses<Model extends IdunModel>(\r\n\t\tmodelClass: Type<Model>,\r\n\t\tbaseUrl: string,\r\n\t\tlist: Model[],\r\n\t\talternates: any = {}\r\n\t) {\r\n\t\tconst responses = {}\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"get\"] = ModelTestData.getResponse(list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"getlist\"] = ModelTestData.getListResponse(list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"getpage\"] = ModelTestData.getPageResponse(list)\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"add\"] = this.localStorageResponse(baseUrl, list, ModelTestData.addResponse(modelClass, list))\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"update\"] = this.localStorageResponse(baseUrl, list, ModelTestData.updateResponse(modelClass, list))\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"markfordeletion\"] = this.localStorageResponse(baseUrl, list, ModelTestData.deleteResponse(modelClass, list))\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"revertdelete\"] = this.localStorageResponse(baseUrl, list, ModelTestData.cancelDeleteResponse(modelClass, list))\r\n\t\tresponses[baseUrl + \"getcount\"] = ModelTestData.getCountResponse(list)\r\n\t\tfor (const i in alternates)\r\n\t\t\tresponses[baseUrl + i] = alternates[i]\r\n\t\treturn responses\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tstatic getResponse<Model extends IdunModel>(list: Model[]) {\r\n\t\treturn (parameters) => {\r\n\t\t\tfor (const i in list)\r\n\t\t\t\tif (+list[i].DBID === +parameters.id)\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn JSON.stringify(list[i])\r\n\t\t\treturn \"\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tstatic getListResponse<Model extends IdunModel>(list: Model[]) {\r\n\t\treturn (parameters) => {\r\n\t\t\treturn JSON.stringify(list)\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tstatic getPageResponse<Model extends IdunModel>(list: Model[]) {\r\n\t\treturn (parameters) => {\r\n\t\t\tconst result = []\r\n\t\t\tconst offset = parameters.page * parameters.pageSize\r\n\t\t\tfor (let i = 0;
